# UltiCode Agent

Python agent runtime for UltiCode's read-only learning workflow. It is a standalone service
module: it does not own business tables, does not write UltiCode data, and never replaces the
Java Owner services for identity, submissions, judging, or persistence.

## Runtime boundary

- `src/ulticode_client.py` calls existing Auth/App HTTP contracts with a server-side cookie session.
- `src/ulticode_tools.py` projects tool results to the model; submission source, identity, error
  details, test payloads, and nested user/problem objects are excluded by default.
- `src/agent_loop.py` owns bounded model → tool → result rounds, timeout, and cancellation behavior.

The current migrated slice provides the U01 read-only client, bounded model/tool loop, field
projection, deterministic tests, a U02 sample-only keyword retrieval/sourced-analysis path, and a
20-development/10-holdout keyword baseline. Full authorized-corpus evaluation, Embedding/Qdrant
comparison, real-model sourced-analysis evidence, and DAV-53 isolation evidence remain incomplete.
- `src/deepseek_model.py` is an external model adapter. Its API key is read from the environment and
  is never logged or committed.
- `e2e_*.py` are opt-in smoke scripts against the local UltiCode stack; unit tests use
  `httpx.MockTransport` and do not call a real service.

## Local checks

From the repository root:

```bash
cd services/agent
uv sync --locked
uv run pytest -q
```

Real local-stack smoke checks are opt-in and require the existing UltiCode environment:

```bash
ULTICODE_E2E_USERNAME=... ULTICODE_E2E_PASSWORD=... uv run python e2e_readonly.py
ULTICODE_E2E_USERNAME=... ULTICODE_E2E_PASSWORD=... DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=... \
  uv run python e2e_model_qa.py
ULTICODE_E2E_USERNAME=... ULTICODE_E2E_PASSWORD=... uv run python e2e_sourced_analysis.py
ULTICODE_E2E_USERNAME=... ULTICODE_E2E_PASSWORD=... DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=... \
  uv run python e2e_sourced_analysis_model.py
```

Both sourced-analysis smokes require the authenticated account to have at least one
`Wrong Answer` submission in the first bounded page; otherwise they exit with a fixed
`no_wrong_answer_submission` status. The smoke scripts emit only fixed status labels and item
counts. They do not print response bodies, cookie names or values, tokens, submission source,
usernames, roles, tool names, source text, or model answer content.
## U02 boundary

U02 is preparing authorized-corpus retrieval and sourced analysis. The checked-in corpus is an
agent-authored synthetic sample for local tests only: it is not a real user submission, an
UltiCode DTO, or licensed user material. Public user solutions are not a licensed corpus merely
because their API is public. Before any future source is sent to a model, record its permission,
scope, version, chunk/source position, and the exact model-input projection. Retrieved source text
is untrusted data, never an instruction source.

The synthetic sample is explicitly `synthetic` and `agent-authored-synthetic`; it is suitable for
the deterministic sample slice only. The repository now includes a 20-development/10-holdout
keyword evaluation baseline, but authorized-corpus evaluation, Embedding/Qdrant comparison,
real-model sourced-analysis evidence, and DAV-53 isolation evidence remain incomplete.

`src/retrieval.py` provides bounded keyword retrieval and source metadata. `src/sourced_analysis.py`
separates observed submission facts from hypotheses and only cites retrieved fragments. Java services
remain the authority for identity, ownership, publication, and submission facts. The tool projections
validate scalar types and bounded string lengths before returning data to the model.

U02 and later phases must preserve U01's regression coverage for unknown tools, invalid arguments,
tool failure, timeout, cancellation, and the absence of raw source/error data in captured model
messages. Do not add write tools until the corresponding DAV-53 isolation and confirmation gates are
satisfied.
